## Overview

Our SaaS application is built on a microservices architecture, where different components handle specific functionalities independently. Each microservice is responsible for a well-defined set of tasks, fostering modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

## Microservices Components

- **Tip 5:** Utilize centralized logging systems for monitoring and troubleshooting across microservices.

### Testing Strategies
- **Tip 6:** Adopt a combination of unit, integration, and end-to-end testing for comprehensive test coverage.
- **Tip 7:** Implement contract testing to validate communication between microservices.


## Shared Knowledge

### Microservices Architecture
Microservices architecture is a design approach where a system is composed of small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. Key principles include modularity, autonomy, resilience, and continuous delivery.

### Programming Languages
Our tech stack includes diverse programming languages such as Node.js, Java, Python, Go, Ruby, and TypeScript. Each language is chosen based on its suitability for the specific microservice's requirements.

### Design Patterns
Design patterns like MVC, CQRS, Event Sourcing, and others are employed to solve common architectural challenges. These patterns ensure scalability, maintainability, and flexibility in our microservices.

### Deployment Strategies
Microservices are deployed using various strategies, including containerization with Docker, serverless architectures, and orchestration with Kubernetes. These approaches optimize scalability and resource utilization.

### Cloud Services
Our infrastructure relies on cloud services from providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. These services include managed databases, serverless computing, message brokers, and identity management solutions.
