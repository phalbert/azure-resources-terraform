# Cookiecutter Templates for New Projects

This folder contains a collection of Cookiecutter templates that can be used to quickly set up new projects. Cookiecutter is a command-line utility that generates projects from project templates, allowing you to bootstrap new projects with predefined directory structures, files, and configurations.

## Usage

To use these templates, follow these steps:

1. Install Cookiecutter by running the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install cookiecutter
    ```

2. Navigate to the desired location where you want to create your new project.

3. Run the following command, replacing `<template-name>` with the name of the desired template:

    ```bash
    cookiecutter /path/to/azure-resources-terraform/app-templates/<template-name>
    ```

    This will prompt you to provide values for any variables defined in the template, such as project name, author name, etc.

4. Once you've provided all the required values, Cookiecutter will generate the project based on the template, creating the necessary files and directories.

5. You can now start working on your new project!

The following templates are available in this folder:
